fizzbuzz
========

I've been doing Web development for more than 20 years.

My first Web site was hosted on the server managed by my uncle at a local university, then on GeoCities. I only had about 5 MB of available space. It had frames, some animated GIFs, but no MIDI file playing in the background. On the first server, I learned some Unix, using Pico to edit files, and Pine to get some mail. Later, I used edit.com—the name of an executable file, not a site—on a DOS computer with no hard disk drive at home, saved the files on floppy disks, and then uploaded them to the Web the first chance I had to access a connected computer.

When I started, there was no "backend" or "frontend". You were called the "webmaster" and were expected to know a little bit of everything. Which is basically what a "full-stack developer" is, like me. It was a time before Netscape created JavaScript. After a brief time writing Perl, I was touting PHP. Did you know Ruby, PHP, and JavaScript were all created in 1995, mere months apart from each other?

Back then, I took my first steps in HTML not because I was pationate about IT. I was merely fascinated by the cultural effects of the digital revolution, with the growing Internet and the shrinking personal computers. On the Web, I was inspired by my first love of graphic design and typography in magazines, and tried to replicate it with tables and dithered GIF files. (CSS back then could barely remove the underline off links.) Also, truth be told, I also found the pixelated icons in Windows 95 cute.

Today, I'm still a Web developer. I long the days when we could experiment with Web design and allow ourselves to be creative rather than making pages with boilerplate templates, blue buttons, and a chock full of trackers. I'm still trying to find opportunities that will let me have fun creating on the Web and other media. I also like making sites that anyone can use, not only on any device, but also in any language or ability, hence my enthusiasm for localization and accessibility.

At least I get the chance to automate things often. It's strange how people, even several developers, still taking the "scenic route" in the work and would rather do everything the longest, most repetitive way. Me, however, I practically write a script for anything I do.

Anyway, recruiters ask me again and again to write "fizz buzz" programs as if I could have cheated my whole career. So, here is the code in different languages. You can browse my commits to see how much time it took to write each of the file. If you want to test it yourself, you can pipe the output into diff and compare it with the content of `expected`, like this:

```
./fizzbuzz.js | diff - expected
./fizzbuzz.php | diff - expected
./fizzbuzz.rb | diff - expected
./fizzbuzz.sh | diff - expected
```

If nothing shows up, there is no difference, so it's good.

Happy reviewing!
