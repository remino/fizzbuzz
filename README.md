fizzbuzz
========

I've been doing Web development for more than 20 years.

Recruiters ask me again and again to write "fizz buzz" programs.

So, here is the code in different languages. You can browse my commits to see how much time it took to write each of the file. If you want to test it yourself, you can run `./test`.

You can also pass script file names to `./test` to test the scripts you want. For example, `./test fizzbuzz.js samyookgu.js`.  By default, all non-hidden fizzbuzz tests will run.

Happy reviewing!

Regards,

Rem
